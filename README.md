This repository contains a simple frontend built with Vite and ESLint. To work with the frontend, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the `frontend` directory.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Run the linter to ensure code quality:
   ```bash
   npm run lint
   ```
4. Build the project with Vite:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

The build output is generated in `frontend/dist`. Both `node_modules` and `dist` are excluded from version control via `.gitignore`.
